%% Tested html conversion on https://ngpdf.com, it looks ok, and checked in
%% its editor.  Result seems as expected, because the
%% \etocthetocitembegintag/\etocthetocitemendtag create one top Reference
%% struct all around.

%% This made me discover that I actually don't need \etoctagReference around
%% an \etocthelinkedname for example.  The \etoctagReference records its
%% argument in the big surrounding Reference struct, but already the linking
%% is enough to interrupt temporarily the "artifact=layout" MC I am a bit
%% worried though in ngpdf.com about the boxes shown in the two panels view.

% This one sets the node, it is the core macro inserting the tagging code as
% well; some expansion is mandatory because \etocthetocitembegintag and
% \etocthetocitemendtag contain information such as whether being located in a
% section or subsection, information which is known only at the time of the
% processing of the toc line by the user defined etoc style.
