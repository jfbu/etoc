\tableofcontents contents again got started in vmode, and etoc added
forcefully a \verb|\par| after contents (even after
\verb|\etocaftercontentshook|) to avoid the present issue.

\section{One}

Root cause seems to be that a \verb|\par| must be executed at the same
grouping level as the \verb|\@starttoc| upstream kernel hooks, which etoc has
borrowed.
